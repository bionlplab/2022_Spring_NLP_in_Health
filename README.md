# HINF 5016: Natural Language Processing in Health

Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies in artificial intelligence. In recent years, NLP applications in Medicine are everywhere because large quantities of free-text information stored in databases are waiting to be explored. In this course, students will gain a thorough introduction to NLP applications and cutting-edge research in Deep Learning for NLP.
